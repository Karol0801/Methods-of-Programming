# Methods of Programming

This repository contains my work for "Methods of Programming" course at Jagiellonian University during the academic year 2022/2023. 

Throughout this course, the primary objective was to introduce students to classical algorithms and fundamental data structures. Below is a short list detailing the algorithms or data structures covered in the solutions:

- **Program 1**: Kadane's Algorithm (Determining the maximum subarray with a non-negative sum of elements in a 2D array)
- **Program 2**: Binary search
- **Program 3**: Stack (Converting expressions between Reverse Polish Notation and Infix notation)
- **Program 4**: Linked lists
- **Program 5**: Mergesort (Modified version using one auxiliary array of length n/2)
- **Program 6**: Knapsack problem
- **Program 7**: Quicksort + Selectionsort
- **Program 8**: Median of Medians

*Each program consists of a single file, adhering to course requirements.*
